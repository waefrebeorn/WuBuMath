WuBu dominance loop — recursive improvement harness.

Each iteration:
  1. RESEARCH  — web_search for latest SOTA in open categories + read the war plan
  2. IMPLEMENT — pick the highest-leverage open gap, write/modify code
  3. MEASURE   — run tests + external benchmarking if applicable
  4. REPORT    — updated state matrix dumped to stdout + state.json
  5. RECURSE   — loop until all categories closed or budget/time limit hit

Usage:
